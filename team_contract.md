## Deadlines
- The last person to work on a task has to text to verify they will submit it, but we are all responsible for checking that it has been sent
- All work must be submitted 24 hours before deadline

## Communication
- Talk as necessary, ask questions in text chat
- Discuss issues you have with anyone else's work

## Roles
- We all carry equal weight in this project & will work together as a team to complete it

## Resolving Issues
- We're going to vote & majority will make the decision, in the case of a tie we will rock, paper, scissors
- If an issue cannot be resolved within the group, Professor Buzard will have the final say. In terms of the extent of her final say, if we have a disagreement within the group that we cannot resolve, we will lay out all of the arguments to Professor Buzard and she will have the final say. (Like a court judge) If we are choosing either A or B she chooses either A or B or can give a suggestion for C. If we do not like C or if the decsion to choose C is not made by all members of the group, we will fall on the decsion made by Professor Buzard, either A or B.
- If a team member is obviously not pulling their weight on an assignment or the final project, the highest grade they can earn on the assignment or project is a letter grade lower than the grade the rest of the team receives
